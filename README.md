# College Report Card Analysis
This repository was created for Proffessor Gotzler's English 105 class at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
It contains the raw data set and the subset of data that was created by manipulating the raw data using Python3.
The repository also includes the Python notebook that documents the process for crafting the subset of data from the original data
## What is the Purpose of this repository?
- This repository is meant to help find what increases graduation rate and median annual income in colleges. This could help universities to increase their graduation rates and improve students finnacial life after graduation.
## Where is this Data from?
- This data is from the US Department of Education under the College Scorecard section. [website](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data)
## What could this data be used for?
- This data could be used to find trends in student outcomes and graduations rates. By making these obervations 
## Data Visualization
-- The subset created using the process outlined in the Python notebook was slightly altered using Microsoft Excel. Both the original subset and the altered subset for the visual can be found in the files of this repository.
--Additionally I used matlab to create Graphs showing the correlation and variance below
